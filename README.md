# NHL Stats Web App


## Overview

This project was made from scratch by me mainly to see what I can do with a large comprehensive API with constantly changing data. It probably helps that I am a big NHL fan as well. This utilizes the NHL's data API. Since the API has no documentation at all, much thanks is given to Github user [dword4](https://github.com/dword4) for putting together data on this API. [Click here](https://github.com/dword4/nhlapi) to visit the NHL API documentation he has put together. 

## How to Run

Either try the online version of the app, [here](https://fikoreborn.github.io/nhl-stats) or clone to your local machine and with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed:

`npm install`

This installs any dependencies

`npm start`

Now you are ready to go and the app should open in a new browser window/tab. 

## Instructions

On the main page, you can see current standings throughout the league for the current season. If the season has not started yet, it will be populated with the previous season's data, aside from roster updates which are updated throughout the offseason.

Click on a team on the top-left corner drop-down to view stats on a specific team. Click on a player name on that page to view individual player stats.
